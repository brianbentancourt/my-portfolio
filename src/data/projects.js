            A web system has been developed with the aim of improving the process of fast food preparation and delivery. The system encompasses various roles for kitchen, delivery, and administration. Its implementation arose from the overwhelming influx of orders experienced by a local company. The system significantly aided in streamlining and expediting the delivery process, ensuring prompt service to customers in record time.
            Some of the main features of the system include:
            \n - Customer registration through Google accounts.
            \n - Online purchases for convenient ordering.
            \n - Real-time order tracking.
            \n - Automatic stock control to maintain inventory levels.
            \n - Raffles for registered customers as an additional incentive.
            \n - Visualization of orders on a map by administrators and delivery personnel.
            \n - Real-time wallet for deliveries
            \n - Charts and reports generation to analyze sales and average delivery times.
            Following its remarkable success, in 2023, a new client from a different location began utilizing the system.

        After spending time coordinating schedules with clients, Agustyle, a barbershop, has been granted the opportunity to implement an online booking system. Now, clients can view the availability of appointments at the establishment by registering through Facebook or Google.
        \nThe administrator has the ability to view and cancel appointments as needed. Additionally, once a client has made a reservation, they have the option to create a reminder in their personal calendar.
        \nAs a result of this solution, it has been observed that the barbershop now has a more stable schedule throughout the month and has experienced a significant increase in reservations. This has allowed for the optimization of the scheduling process and improved efficiency in time management for both the establishment and its clients.
