        I developed the website for Electrica Caporale, an online store that offers lighting and electrical products. Some key features of the platform include:
        
        \n - User registration with Google and Facebook authentication.
        \n - Point accumulation system managed by the merchant.
        \n - Integration of Google Analytics and a DataStudio dashboard to visualize visit results.
        
        \n Please note that Electrica Caporale has closed its operations in 2023, and the project has come to an end.
